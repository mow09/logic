# LOGIC
Like any IQ logic learnable.
The general idea of this project is building a solver for typical IQ-test or logic games as sudoku.

## Sudoku
A well known logic game which gives an easy base-line for this project. It works with matrices (n, m) as in image processing.

The here focused sudoku is a 9x9 field which is split in so called superareas, horizontals and verticals. A superarea is a 3x3 matrix. Horizontals and verticals are 1x9 (9x1) vectors/arrays.

The only rule is that every superarea, horizontal and vertical just contains the number from [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].
